Generate a general Spanish narrative story that follows this structure and guidelines:

1. The narrative should be between 80 and 90 words.
2. The story must incorporate a variety of tenses (e.g., imperfecto, pretérito, condicional, futuro) in its conjugated verbs.
3. The narrative should be written as a single paragraph.
4. Create a "paragraphWithBlanks" version where only a few key conjugated verbs are replaced by blanks. Immediately after each blank, include the corresponding infinitive form in parentheses (with a space before the parenthesis).
5. Include arrays for:
   - "conjugatedVerbs": containing only the conjugated verbs that were replaced by blanks.
   - "tense": the Spanish labels for the tenses of each replaced verb (e.g., "pretérito", "condicional", "futuro", etc.).
6. Do not include context verbs (those not replaced by blanks) in the "conjugatedVerbs" and "tense" arrays.
7. Output the final result as a JavaScript code block defining a dictionary object.

Example keys should be: "paragraph", "paragraphWithBlanks", "conjugatedVerbs", "infinitiveVerbs", and "tense".
